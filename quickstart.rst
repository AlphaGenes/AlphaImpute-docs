|ai| comes with two different flavors: *Standard* and *Cluster*. The `standard version`_ of |ai| is thought to be run in machines where the user has no restrictions about the device resources in terms of memory or number of processors. For users who want to use |ai| in servers where jobs are controlled by queuing systems, the `cluster version`_ is recomended.

To run |ai|, just type ``AlphaImpute`` on the console and press *ENTER*. After welcoming the user with this message::

|ai| has to be run in 4 times in order to: 1) compute genotype probabilities; 2) phase animals genotyped at high-density; 3) impute and phase genotype data of all individuals in the population; and 4) summarise results and write the outputs. The four different steps in which |ai| is run are controlled by the option ``RestartOption`` in the ``AlphaImputeSpec.txt`` file (see section :ref:`RestartOption`).

Compute Genotype Probabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first time |ai| is run, ``RestartOption`` has to be set to ``1``. This causes |ai| to create the folder structure::

  GeneProb/
  InputFiles/
  IterateGeneProb/
  Miscellaneous/
  Phasing/
  Results/

After creating the folders, |ai| computes the genotype probabilities. To speed up this computation, |ai| splits chromosomes into non-overlapping blocks of markers of the same size, and it computes genotype probabilities for each block in parallel. The size of these blocks depends on the number of processors specified in the spec file (``NumberOfProcessorsAvailable``). For each processor, a folder ``GeneProb/GeneProbX`` is created containing:

* ``GeneProbSpec.txt``: The file of parameters or commonly the *spec* file
* **GeneProbForAlphaImpute**: The executable of GeneProb.

|ai| automatically runs **GeneProbForAlphaImpute** for each ``GeneProbX`` folder according to the spec file.

Phase animals gentoyped at HD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second time |ai| is run, ``RestartOption`` has to be set to ``2``. This causes |ai| to phase the haplotypes of those individuals genotyped at high-density. Phasing is computed across all markers according to the phasing strategies that have been set by parameters ``CoreAndTailLengths`` and ``CoreLengths``. For each core in the spec file, |ai| computes two phasing rounds by running |ap| in ``Offset`` and ``NotOffset`` mode (Hickey *et al*. (2011) [1]_).

|ai| runs the phasing rounds in different parallel processes. It is worth to notice that the number of processors has to be equal to ``NumberOfProcessorsAvailable`` :math:` = 2 \times` ``NumberPhasingRuns``. For each processor, a folder ``Phasing/PhaseX`` is created containing:

* ``AlphaPhaseSpec.txt``: The spec file of parameters.
* ``AlphaPhase``: The executable of |ap|.

|ai| automatically runs |ap| for each ``PhaseX`` folder according to the spec file.

|ap| can phase hundreds of thousands of animals in under a day. To make use of this capability, the option ``LargeDatasets`` has to be set to ``Yes``. In this case, two more parameters are needed (see :ref:`LargeDatasets` section for more information).


Impute genotype data for all individuals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The third time |ai| is run, ``RestartOption`` has to be set to ``3``. This makes |ai| to impute genotypes for all the individuals in the genotype file. Imputation is based on the phased haplotypes of the individuals genotyped at high-density (`Phase animals gentoyped at HD`_).

In some situations, imputation thresholds are not met and markers cannot be imputed. To overcome this, |ai| offers two different solutions: To run GeneProbs or to apply a hidden Markov model.

The default solution is to run **GeneProbForAlphaImpute** to calculate genotype probabilities based on the new genotype information. |ai| creates the folder structure ``IterateGeneProb/GeneProbX``. Each ``GeneProbX`` folder contains:

* ``GeneProbSpec.txt``: The file of parameters or commonly the *spec* file
* **GeneProbForAlphaImpute**: The executable of GeneProb.

A more sophisticated approach is to impute the missing genotypes with a hidden Markov model. To use the Markov model after the imputation process, ``HMMOption`` has to be set to ``Yes`` and ``RestartOption`` to ``3``. The hidden Markov model is controlled by the five parameters in option ``HmmParameters``. These five parameters are referred to (in order):

* *number of haplotypes*
* *number of burn-in rounds*
* *number of rounds*
* *number of processors available*
* *seed*

The parameters shown in the example spec file work well for most cases, but the user can set other values (see :ref:`HMMParameters` section for more information about how to set optimal parameters).

Once the hidden Markov model has finished, |ai| outputs the most likely genotypes, genotype dosages and genotype probabilities into different files:

* ``ImputeGenotypes.txt``
* ``ImputeGenotypesHMM.txt``
* ``ImputeGenotypesProbabilities.txt``
* ``GenotypeProbabilities.txt``

|ai| provides similar information for phasing results and allele probabilities:

* ``ImputePhase.txt``
* ``ImputePhaseHMM.txt``
* ``ImputePhaseProbabilities.txt``

Summarise results and write the outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the segregation analysis approach (i.e. **GeneProbForAlphaImpute**) was used during the imputation step, results have to be summarised. So, |ai| has to be run a final time with the ``RestartOption`` set to ``4``. This writes out files with the most likely genotypes, genotype dosages and genotype probabilities

* ``ImputeGenotypes.txt``
* ``ImputeGenotypesProbabilities.txt``
* ``GenotypeProbabilities.txt``

|ai| provides similar information for phasing results and allele probabilities:

* ``ImputePhase.txt``
* ``ImputePhaseProbabilities.txt``

  GeneProb/

* ``GeneProbSpec.txt``: The file of parameters or commonly the *spec* file
* **GeneProbForAlphaImpute**: The executable of GeneProb.

Because each cluster system is potentially different, |ai| does not run **GeneProbForAlphaImpute** for each ``GeneProbX`` automatically, and after creating the folders, |ai| stops with this message:

.. warning:: ``Restart option 1 stops program before Geneprobs jobs have been submitted``

The user is supposed to do so according to his/her cluster characteristics. The easiest way to run all the GeneProb processes is to create a script file that automatically send them to the system queue.

Phase animals gentoyped at HD for clusters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second time |ai| is run, ``RestartOption`` has to be set to ``2``. This causes |ai| to phase the haplotypes of those animals genotyped at high-density.

As before, |ai| split the chromosome into different cores in order to phase the haplotypes of individuals genotyped at high-density in different parallel processes. Phasing is computed across all markers according to the phasing strategies that have been set by parameters ``CoreAndTailLengths`` and ``CoreLengths``. For each core in the spec file, two phasing rounds are computed by running |ap| in ``Offset`` and ``NotOffset`` mode (Hickey *et al*. (2011) [1]_).

* ``AlphaPhaseSpec.txt``: The spec file of parameters.
* ``AlphaPhase``: The executable of |ap|.

However, |ai| stops before processing the phasing with the message:

.. warning:: ``Restart option 2 stops program before Phasing has been managed``

and does not run |ap| in the different ``PhaseX`` folders. The user is supposed to do so according to his/her cluster characteristics. The easiest way to run all the GeneProb processes is to create a script file that automatically send them to the system queue.

|ap| can phase hundreds of thousands of animals in under a day. To make use of this capability, the option ``LargeDatasets`` has to be set to ``Yes``. In this case, two more parameters are needed (see :ref:`LargeDatasets` section for more information).

Impute genotype data for all individuals

* **GeneProbForAlphaImpute**: The executable of GeneProb.

|ai| does not compute the genotype probabilities automatically and it stops with the message:

.. warning:: ``Restart option 3 stops program before Iterate Geneprob jobs have been submitted``

The user is supposed to do so according to his/her cluster characteristics. The easiest way to run all the GeneProb processes is to create a script file that automatically send them to the system queue.
